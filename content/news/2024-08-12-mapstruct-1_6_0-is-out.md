I am very happy to announce the final release of MapStruct 1.6!
This is our 6th major release since November 2015.

As you can see with this release we decided to remove the `.Final` and only use the version (1.6.0).
We'll keep doing this for final releases.

Besides bug fixes, the 1.6 release brings some new exciting features:

* Access to target / source property names in conditional and mapping methods
* Conditional mapping for source parameters
* Passing annotations to generated code
* Add javadoc to generated code
* New built-in conversions

[Beta2](/news/2024-05-11-mapstruct-1_6_0_Beta2-is-out.md),
[RC1](/news/2024-07-20-mapstruct-1_6_0_RC1-is-out.md)

### What's inside

This major release brings few big new features for MapStruct:
* [Access to target / source property names in conditional and mapping methods](/news/2023-11-04-mapstruct-1_6_0_Beta1-is-out.md/#access-to-target--source-property-names-in-conditional-and-mapping-methods)
* [Conditional mapping for source parameters](/news/2023-11-04-mapstruct-1_6_0_Beta1-is-out.md/#conditional-mapping-for-source-parameters)
* [Passing annotations to generated code](/documentation/stable/reference/html/#adding-annotations)
* [Add javadoc to generated code](/documentation/stable/reference/html/#javadoc)

In total 90 issues have been fixed between the 1.5.0.Final and 1.6.0 release.

### What's next

We currently have few issues that have been requested a lot:
* [Support Java 8 Optional](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct/issues/674)
* [Support or NonNull / Nullable annotations](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct/issues/1243)

and we have some issues with requesting support for Kotlin.
The most requested here are:

* [Support KSP](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct/issues/2522)
* [Support for Kotlin data classes](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct/issues/2281)

We would like to see if we can tackle some of these issues in the next release.
The KSP support is something that might require a lot of work and refactoring in the internals of MapStruct, but we will see.

### Stats

Like every final release, we like to release some statistics about the project.
We are very proud and thankful to our growing community.
It is really satisfying to see how everyone helps each other in our on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mapstruct) or in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct/discussions).
We currently have 7000+ stars and 133 contributors on GitHub.
More than 100 000 people are using our [IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10036-mapstruct-support) plugin.

Most impressive though are the download numbers we get from the Maven Central repo.
As an example here are the numbers for the _org.mapstruct:mapstruct-processor_ artifact:

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/images/downloads_08-2023_08-2024.png" style="padding-bottom: 3px;"/>
</div>

The number of Downloads compared to the time we released 1.5.0.Final has more than doubled (increased by 2.3 times).
